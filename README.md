## Unveiling the News Chronicle

Greetings! I am Udhav Sharma, an aspiring Computer Science and Engineering savant at GZSCCET (Batch of 2021-25). It is with immense pride that I present to you my brainchild: The Epoch Herald software. Forged during my intensive Java Developer apprenticeship under the sagacious guidance of the distinguished author of "Real Java," Mr. Rajesh K. Bansal, this software stands as a monument to my journey as a Java virtuoso hailing from Bathinda. This opus aims to revolutionize and streamline a gamut of time-intensive tasks: from meticulous record-keeping to lightning-fast information retrieval, and even the automated dispatch of hawkers to both our nascent and enduring patrons.
