## About This Project

Greetings! I am Udhav Sharma, a Computer Science and Engineering student at GZSCCET (2021-25). I proudly present my project, the Blood Bank Management software, developed during my Java Developer training under the guidance of the esteemed author of the book "Real Java," Mr. Rajesh K. Bansal. This software serves as a testament to my journey as a Java developer based in Bathinda. The project's aim is to streamline and automate various time-consuming tasks like record-keeping, blood quantity updates, and record searches.
